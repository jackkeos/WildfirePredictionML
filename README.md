# Predicting Wildfire Acreage using Machine Learning

## Introduction

Welcome to my Capstone Project for BrainStation. This project focuses on predicting wildfire acreage using machine learning. For a more comprehensive introduction to the project, please refer to the first Jupyter Notebook. Please note that this project is a work in progress as I continue to optimize machine learning algorithms, especially neural networks.

## Installation

### Notebook 1: "intro_and_EDA.ipynb"
This notebook requires Python 3, along with the following libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### Notebook 2: "modeling.ipynb"
This notebook builds upon the packages mentioned in Notebook 1 and includes:
- Scikit-Learn
- XGBoost

### Notebook 3: "deeplearning.ipynb"
This notebook utilizes all the previously mentioned packages as well as TensorFlow and Keras, implemented in a separate Conda environment.

## Data

The dataset used in this project was obtained from the US Forest Service through Kaggle. You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behroozsohrabi/us-wildfire-records-6th-edition?resource=download). It comprises 2.3 million wildfire records in the US spanning from 1992 to 2020. The dataset provides details about fire location, timing, property ownership, and more. You can find a complete data dictionary of the original dataset and the finalized data set in the first notebook, "Introduction and EDA."

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to my instructors at BrainStation and my fellow classmates for their valuable insights and assistance as I worked on this project.
